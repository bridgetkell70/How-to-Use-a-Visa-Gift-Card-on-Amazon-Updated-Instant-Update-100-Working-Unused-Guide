### How Does a Visa Gift Card Work on Amazon?

**Visa Gift Card Basics**
A Visa gift card functions just like a debit or credit card but with a pre-loaded balance. It can be used at any merchant that accepts Visa cards, including Amazon. The major difference is that these cards are not linked to a bank account and cannot be replenished once the balance is spent.

**Amazon's Payment System**
Amazon accepts various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, Amazon gift cards, and other forms of payment. Visa gift cards are treated like debit cards, meaning the card's balance is charged when you make a purchase.
